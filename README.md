# Octo Game
Octo Game is a 2D party game heavily inspired by [Netflix's](https://www.netflix.com/) hit series ***Squid Game***, set in a dystopian future. Octo Game features a series of minigames in which the player and up to seven others battle against each other to stand atop the leaderboard and win first place. Each minigame will test the players' reflexes, memory, or logic. Taking a cue from *Squid Game* itself, many of the minigames are based on childhood games, such as **Red Light, Green Light**, **Hide and Seek**, **Four-Square**, and **King of the Hill**. With each variation on a beloved classic game, Octo Game delivers a familiar experience for players, while offering a unique spin on the original.
