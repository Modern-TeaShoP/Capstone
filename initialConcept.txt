# Modern TeaShoP Group Initial Game Concepts

### Idea: 
Round-based online multiplayer game with an end goal of outlasting all other players to claim in-game prize money.

### Description: 
Taking inspiration from Netflix’s hit series Squid Game, groups of eight players are pitted against each other in a winner-takes-all collection of minigames designed to test players’ speed, coordination, problem solving ability, and survivability in a dystopian world.

### User Stories: 
Seong Gi-Hun, a player in the game, finds himself in a room with seven other players, and is told that the winner of the competition will earn a large sum of money. Gi-Hun then plays (sometimes on his own, sometimes teamed with others) a series of games to determine the overall winner. During the course of the game, Gi-hun’s stats may change according to his performance in the previous games. In the final game, he finds himself facing off against all the other players, with a bonus depending on how well he has done so far. Finally, as Gi-hun outlasts all the other players, he is victorious and takes home the prize money.
